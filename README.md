# GitVersionControlBasic1
the final project of Git Version Control Basic

This is a project on Git version Control Basic. 
1. # PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project explores the git languages and the git version control. the project gives a deep understanding on version control system and why it is needed. it also gives deep understanding on version control system as well as how to apply git commands from different terminals.

# PURPOSE

The purpose of the mini project is to gain mastery in the use of git both on the website and the terminal. 
the purpose is also to understand how git version control system solves problem 
The purpose is also to understand the leading versiob control system.
The purpose is also to explore various git hub commands and apply it on the terminal. 
The purpose is also to gain mastery in git commands and apply it on my two terminals to act as Tom and Jerry
The purpose is to be able to run the initial setup of a git profile and to be able to clone repository. 
The purpose is also to be able to create a file on git and edit the file. 
another purpose is to be able to create new branches as well as push and pull request. 
The purpose is also to be able to merge. 



# THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
i would be working on two terminals for tom and Jerry and i will also be creating two branches for the respectively. 

the first step is to clone the repository on the terminals and the image below depicts this. 
![1img](./1img.png)
![2img](./2img.png)

after cloning the repository on my terminal, the next thing is to go into the cloned repository. this is done using the command "cd" and the image above depicts this. however after that i created the file called "index.html" on the mainbranch after which i went ahead to create a new branch for Tom using the command "git checkout -b update-navigation"

the image below depicts this 
![4img](./4img.png)

after which i entered into the index file created earlier and editted the file. the image below depicts this
![3img](./3img.png)

after which i saved the changes. the next thing is to follow this sequence 
1. git add . 
2. git commit -m 
3. git push

the image below depicts this. however during the course of running this command there were some issues. i had to switch from 'https' to'ssh' for my remote so that git would stop asking me for username and password when i am trying to push. i had to generate an ssh key and added the ssh key to GitHub afterwhich i changed the remote url to use ssh.once this was done i went back to pushing again and it was successful.

the next thing is to pull request on my git hub account and then merge the file and the image below depicts this as well as merge the file.

# JERRYS WORK 
the first thing i would be doing is to run this cmmands 
'git checkout -b add-contact-info' this is to create a new branch for Jerry after which i checked back to the main branch and then the next command to run is the git pull origin main to make sure the changes on the main file is saved on the new branch as well. 
the image below depicts this. 
![9img](./9img.png)
![10img](./10img.png)

the next thing to do is to go back to my newly created branch and rthen merge changes with the main. after which i will enter into the 'index.html' file to create changes for jerry. 
the image below depicts this 
![11img](./11img.png)
![12img](./12img.png)
![13img](./13img.png)


the next thing to do is to add the changes after which i will commit the changes with a message then push the changes. the image below depicts this and the command below shows this 

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "the comment"
3. git push origin add-contact-info

the image below depicts that 
![14img](./14img.png)

the next thing to do is to go to my github profile and pull request into main and then merge the changes. the image below depicts this. 
![15img](./15img.png)
![16img](./16img.png)
![17img](./17img.png)
![18img](./18img.png)

everything was successful and the image below depicts this

# CONCLUSION
This project has been been successful completely as Tom and Jerry were able to work on the same file simultaneously, without overwriting each others work. Git also tracked down their changes allowing them to merge their changes seamlessly into the main projext. i was able to carry put all the task and it was successful. I understand the power of using version control service  like git for collaborative development ensuring that all contributions are preserved and integrated effectively and efficiently.
